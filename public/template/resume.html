            More focused on developing the new balance management
            system I was able to be one of the tech leaderships on the
            team, leading technical discussions with my own team,
            different engineering teams and different areas of the
            company. In this project I worked building the new balance
            architecture using technologies such as Java, Kafka and
            Oracle, preparing the architecture to be shard-ready for the
            near future. I also worked in the hiring processing helping in
            interviews for engineers of different levels.

        <p>
            Worked on the breaking the financial movements domain
            model into a more scalable and resilient one, guaranteeing
            more availability in critical functions for the customers
            and the company, such as the customers’ balance and the
            internal accounting system.

            Developing the new accounting system I had the opportunity
            to work with different engineering teams and different
            areas of the company. I manly worked with Kotlin, Go,
            Kafka and Oracle, achieving an excellent performance and a
            considerably higher scalability than the previous system.

            Helped on the financial movements microservices
            maintenance, performing many optimizations to enhance the
            performance and scalability of these systems, most of the
            optimizations were related to database use(Oracle) and
            lock contention reduction.

            I also worked developing new services in a different
            domain related to receivables because of a new regulation
            by the central bank of Brazil, I primarily worked with
            Java, Go, Kafka and Cassandra.

            Working in one of Brazil’s the biggest financial services
            companies, I was part of the team responsible for the
            financial movements domain, learning how to build
            resilient and scalable distributed systems. I also
            developed internal tools for the treasury department,
            using Java and MySQL.

            At CRAAM I worked at the automation of the 7GHz radio
            telescope(located at my university in São Paulo),
            analysing data from solar flares captured by the 7Ghz and
            developing libraries for data analysis of solar events of
            multiple telescopes.

            For my final project I decided to research databases,
            specifically PostgreSQL and transaction isolation. The
            goal of the project was to study PostgreSQL serializable
            isolation level in comparison with pessimistic
            locking. Paper: <a href="https://dspace.mackenzie.br/handle/10899/30904">

            concurrency scenarios in PostgreSQL"</a>.
